In digit dp we start from msb of a number and try to explore all numbers <= max_number. 
If the prefix explored so far is equal to prefix of max_number then we are on the edge ( in recursion we mark it as f = 0).
At any instant if we take a digit smaller than corresponding digit in max_number, we pass f = 1. Hence in recursion function if f is passed 1, means prefix is already less, so
now current digit can be anything from 1 to 9. 
If we closesly see recusive function, we will know states can be visted again and again, hence we memoise it.
Basically in recursive function of digit dp we explore all the numbers lesser than max_number and working is like a trie.
